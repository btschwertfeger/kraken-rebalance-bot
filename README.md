## üìù The Strategy

This algorithm can buy and sell one or more Spot assets without leverage.

The goal is to hold a certain amount of each base currency so that, for example, there is always about $1000 worth of BTC in the portfolio. If the price of Bitocoin increases so that there is now $1050 worth of Bitcoin in the portfolio, the excess $50 is sold. If the price of Bitcoin falls, so that the Bitcoin in the portfolio are only worth $950, the algorithm buys Bitcoin, to hold a value of about $1000 in Bitcoin in the portfolio again.

The algorithm checks the price range every 6 hours by default. The margin, from how many percent price difference the algorithm becomes active, can also be adjusted.

Actions can be logged on the command-line using the logging module with active INFO-level and can also be sent to a telegram bot.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick start and configuration

### 0. Check the source code of this algorithm on GitHub and read the README.md carefully

- https://github.com/btschwertfeger/Kraken-Rebalance-Bot

### 1. Install the Python module:

```bash
python3 -m pip install kraken-rebalance-bot
```

### 2. Register at Kraken and generate API keys with trading access:

- https://www.kraken.com/u/security/api

### 3. (optional) Create a Telegram Bot to get notified when the algorithm takes action

1. Create a bot using <a href="https://t.me/BotFather" target="_blank">@BotFather</a>
2. Write down/remember the token
3. Start <a href="https://t.me/RawDataBot" target="_blank">@RawDataBot</a> and write down your personal chat id

### 4. Setup the configuration and start the algorithm

#### a.) Using docker

Build an image and pass a config when starting the container:

```bash
docker build -t krb:latest examples/docker
docker run --env-file examples/docker/.docker.env krb
```

(`examples/docker/.docker.env` contains the configuration for this bot)

Output:

```bash
2023/01/25 18:54:29 main,line: 42  WARNING | Not using telegram.
2023/01/25 18:54:29 bot,line: 59     INFO | Starting the `kraken-rebalance-bot`
2023/01/25 18:54:29 bot,line: 62     INFO | Using scheduled times @['00:00', '06:00', '12:00', '18:00']
...
```

#### b.) Using a Python script

In the following a minimal working example is shown that uses this strategy to hold a `target_quantity` of $500 of ETH and $500 worth of XBT. Both are traded agains USD. The `demo` key must be set to `False` to enable the trading functionality. Of course, this also works with only one asset, too.

```python
from krakenRebalanceBot.bot import RebalanceBot

def main() -> None:
    bot = RebalanceBot(
        key='kraken-api-key',
        secret='kraken-secret-key',
        config={
            'base_currency': ['ETH', 'XBT'],    # base assets to maintain
            'quote_currency': ['USD', 'USD'],   # quote assets to trade with
            'target_quantity': [500, 500],      # how many of the base to hold (value in quote)
            'quote_to_maintain': [200, 200],    # freezed quote/dont trade with this
            'margin': [0.035, 0.035],           # buy/sell threshold
            'lowest_buy_price': [1000, 15000],  # dont buy below this price
            'times': ['06:00', '18:00'],        # optional of use_build_in_sheduler is True
            'use_build_in_sheduler': False,     # if set to False, the script will only run once
            'demo': True,                       # set to false to enable trading
            'telegram': {                       # optional to get notified via telegram
                'token': 'telegram-bot-token',
                'chat_id': 'your-telegram-chat-id'
            }
    })
    bot.run()  # start the bot

if __name__ == '__main__': main()
```

The file `/examples/main.py` serves as an example on how to initialize and run this trading algorithm using the `.env` and `config.json` files (see <a href="https://github.com/btschwertfeger/Kraken-Rebalance-Bot" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). There is also a Jupyter notebook in which one can test the algorithm without risking any assets.

- <b>To see the output on the command line you need to enable logging with level INFO as shown in the example script.</b>
- <b>If `use_build_in_sheduler` is enabled, there will be no output until the time is one of `times`.</b>

If `use_build_in_sheduler` is set to `False`, the program is executed once and ends after the iteration over all assets. This offers the possibility to create own scripts, which execute this algorithm at individual times (e.g. using <a href="https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Cron/" target="_blank">cron</a>).

## üìç Notes

- Make sure to always have enough quote currency in your Kraken portfolio. Too low `target_quantity` values can cause the bot not to trade or even crash. Therefore, pay attention to the <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050845612-Minimum-order-size-volume-for-trading-and-decimal-precision-for-residents-of-Japan-" target="_blank">minimum order sizes</a>.

  - Example:
    - situation:
      - minimal order size of ETH is 0.01
      - price of ETH: $1300
      - `margin` is set to 0.04
      - `target_quantity` is 200
    - what will happen:
      - If your actual holdings of ETH is $192 the bot tries to buy Ethereum with a volume of $8 because $200 - $200 \* 0.04 will trigger the buy order. But the minimum ordersize of Ethereum is 0.01 ETH (see <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050845612-Minimum-order-size-volume-for-trading-and-decimal-precision-for-residents-of-Japan-" target="_blank">here</a>), and with a price of $1300 0.01 ETH equals $13 so: $13 < $8 will raise an error.
  - So make sure that the minimum order sizes of the respective assets are consistent with the `margin` value and the `target_quantity`. The example would work if the `targe_quantity` is set to 500, because $500 _ 0.04 = $20 which is larger than $1300 _ 0.01 = $13.
  - Also make sure that there is enough quote currency, otherwise the bot cannot buy anything.

- This strategy is one of the simplest and most basic approaches for trading cryptocurrencies. For this reason, it should be noted here that this does not necessarily lead to profits. Before running such an algorithm, everyone should be clear about what products are being traded, what these products are for in the first place, and what makes them valuable. Even the best companies, stocks, materials, and also cryptocurrencies can become worthless from one day to the next, so everyone should do their own research and make their decisions based on these results.

- It has been decided here not to present any material regarding the profitability of this algorithm, as this could lead you to make your decisions based on my successes and failures. What works once or over a long period of time does not necessarily work in the future. But please let me know what you think about this basic algorithm and what could be improved.

- For any problems, issues, and errors, please open an issue.
